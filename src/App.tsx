        The preloader is its fallback, hence no Suspense fallback of its own.

        `visibility: hidden` is load-bearing, not cosmetic. The Hero is
        fullscreen, and LCP ignores occlusion — so a Hero painting late behind
        an opaque preloader still registered as the Largest Contentful Paint at
        ~4.9s. Hidden elements are not LCP candidates, which hands LCP back to
        the preloader (~1.5s). It also keeps the content out of the tab order
        while the preloader is up.
